Terminal showing test of the modified function:

PS C:\Users\I535072\Documents\GitHub\jupyter\oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai\final_project> python3 -c "from emotion_detection import emotion_detector; print('Function imported successfully')"
Function imported successfully

Note: The function is now modified to return formatted output with:
- Individual emotion scores (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness)
- Dominant emotion detection
- Proper dictionary structure as required

The function is ready for testing with the Watson API when connection is available.
